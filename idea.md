# codify note frequency of notes so piano can be played
# create a mapping of note names to their frequencies
# this can be used to generate sound waves for each note
# create songs by combining these frequencies in sequence with timing information

# then combine with a water drop physics engine to create water drop , splash, and ripple effects that correspond to the music being played
# this would create a visual music experience where the water drops dance to the music being played
# water drop placement is random but colors and sizes can be varied based on the note frequency and intensity
# this would be a fun and interesting way to visualize music through water drops
